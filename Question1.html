<!-- Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other? -->
Ans: CSS Flexbox:
One-dimensional layout: Flexbox works in a single direction, either a row or a column. Itâ€™s ideal for managing the layout of items along a single axis.
Flexibility: It is highly adaptable for dynamically adjusting content based on available space, making it great for responsive designs.
Use Case: Flexbox is best for arranging items in a row or column, such as navigation bars, horizontal/vertical lists, or aligning elements in a single direction [2].
CSS Grid:
Two-dimensional layout: CSS Grid allows for controlling both rows and columns simultaneously, offering a grid-based layout.
Structured layout: Its perfect for building more complex layouts that require control over both dimensions.
Use Case: Grid is ideal for creating page layouts, dashboards, or any design that needs control over rows and columns.
When to use each:
Use Flexbox when you need to control alignment along one axis (rows or columns).
Use Grid when you need to design more structured two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
