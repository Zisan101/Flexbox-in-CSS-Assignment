<!-- Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout mode
justify-conten
align-item/
gap
flex-directio
flex-wrap -->
justify-content: This property aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It controls the distribution of space between items and can take values like flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around to manage item alignment effectively.

align-items: This property aligns flex items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis). It can be set to values like flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch, determining how items are positioned within the flex container vertically.

gap: This shorthand property creates consistent spacing between flex items. It simplifies adding space without extra margin styles by setting both row and column gaps simultaneously.

flex-direction: This property defines the direction in which the flex items are laid out in the flex container. Possible values include row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse, establishing the main axis of the layout.

flex-wrap: This property controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines when they overflow the flex container. It accepts values like nowrap (default), wrap, and wrap-reverse, managing item flow within the container.
